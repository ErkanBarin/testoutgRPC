Architecting a Robust Playwright Test Automation Framework for Elixir-based gRPC ServicesThis report outlines a comprehensive approach to establishing a well-organized, clean, and robust Playwright test automation framework using JavaScript (ESM) specifically tailored for testing Elixir-based gRPC services within an architecture featuring a central 'LAB' gRPC gateway and a separate protobuf repository, all interconnected via 'lab_umbrella'. The strategies presented address common challenges, including protobuf management, ESM-compatible gRPC client stub generation, asynchronous operation handling, and effective test structuring.1. Foundational Framework Structure and OrganizationEstablishing a clean and maintainable directory structure is paramount for the longevity and scalability of any test automation framework. Given the use of Playwright with JavaScript (ESM) for testing Elixir gRPC services, a dedicated Git repository for the test automation framework is highly recommended. This separation provides a cleaner development environment, allows for independent toolchain management, and simplifies access control if needed, especially since the test framework (JavaScript) uses a different language and ecosystem than the main application (Elixir).11.1. Recommended Directory StructureThe following directory structure is proposed for the Playwright gRPC test automation framework:playwright-grpc-tests/

This structure organizes tests by RPC type for clarity.2 The protos/ directory serves as a local cache for .proto definitions fetched from the central repository, which are then used to populate the generated/ directory with JavaScript client stubs. The lib/ directory promotes code reuse for client interactions and utility functions, adhering to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles. Configuration is centralized in the config/ directory. This clear separation of concerns enhances maintainability and makes it easier for team members to navigate and contribute to the framework. The "lab_umbrella" nature of the primary Elixir application suggests that changes to gRPC interfaces might be frequent. Therefore, the versioning and synchronization strategy for this test repository, relative to the Elixir umbrella project, needs careful consideration. While a separate repository simplifies the toolchain by isolating JavaScript dependencies from Elixir's, it necessitates a robust mechanism to ensure the tests are always compatible with the deployed gRPC services.1.2. Integrating Your Separate Protobuf RepositoryA critical aspect of testing gRPC services is ensuring that the test framework uses the correct and up-to-date .proto definitions from the central protobuf repository. Several strategies can be employed, each with its own trade-offs:
StrategyDescriptionProsConsBest Fit for Your ArchitectureGit SubmoduleThe protobuf repository is added as a submodule to the Playwright test framework repository. The parent repository pins a specific commit of the submodule. 4Explicit version pinning; atomic commits in the parent repo reflect proto version changes.Can be complex to manage for teams unfamiliar with submodule workflows; updates are manual. 4If strict, explicit versioning of protos tied to test framework versions is paramount and the team is comfortable with submodule workflows.Build Script SyncAn npm script (e.g., in package.json) fetches/copies .proto files from a specific tag/branch of the protobuf repo into the local protos/ directory during test setup or a build process. This can utilize git archive or custom scripting. 5More flexible than submodules; easily automated; allows fetching specific versions/tags; simpler for developers not familiar with submodules.Less explicit version pinning directly in git history (relies on script logic/tags); requires careful script maintenance.A good balance of automation and control, especially if the proto repo is tagged regularly. Often the most practical for CI/CD.Versioned Artifact (e.g., private npm package)Proto definitions are packaged and versioned (e.g., as @mycompany/lab-protos). The test framework lists this as a devDependency. 8Standard dependency management via npm/yarn; clear versioning; simplifies CI. 9Adds overhead of publishing/maintaining this proto package. If publishing pre-generated JS stubs, it might conflict with the desire to generate ESM-specific stubs in the test framework.For larger organizations or when protos are shared across many diverse projects and languages, providing a stable, versioned contract.
Recommendation: For the described architecture with a separate protobuf repository and the need for a clean JavaScript test framework, the Build Script Sync approach offers a pragmatic balance. It provides robust automation for CI/CD and developer setup, coupled with the flexibility to fetch specific versions (tags or branches) of the .proto files. This method avoids the steeper learning curve and potential complexities associated with Git submodules 4 while ensuring the test framework can stay synchronized with the evolving gRPC contracts. If the protobuf repository already publishes versioned artifacts containing the .proto files, that would represent an even cleaner and more standardized integration path.9The choice of strategy significantly impacts the developer workflow and the CI/CD pipeline. A build script approach, for instance, necessitates well-maintained scripts and clear conventions for referencing protobuf versions (e.g., always using the main branch, specific release tags, or commit SHAs).2. Generating JavaScript (ESM) gRPC Client Stubs for @grpc/grpc-jsThe objective is to generate gRPC client stubs compatible with @grpc/grpc-js and suitable for an ES Module (ESM) JavaScript environment. This is crucial for aligning with modern JavaScript practices.Core Tools and Considerations:
@grpc/grpc-js: This is the official pure JavaScript gRPC library for Node.js and will be the runtime for client-server communication.12
grpc-tools: This package provides grpc_tools_node_protoc, which wraps the protoc compiler and the Node gRPC plugin. It is traditionally used for generating Node.js gRPC code.13 However, grpc-tools primarily generates CommonJS modules. Direct ESM output for @grpc/grpc-js stubs is not a straightforward built-in feature.15
@bufbuild/protoc-gen-es: A modern tool, often used with the Buf CLI, for generating ESM (and TypeScript) from .proto files.16 While excellent for ESM messages, its direct generation of @grpc/grpc-js compatible service stubs might require additional tooling or wrappers, as it's often geared towards @bufbuild/connect.16
protoc-gen-ts (e.g., thesayyn/protoc-gen-ts): A protoc plugin for generating TypeScript, which can also output JavaScript. This tool offers options to target @grpc/grpc-js and can be configured for ESM output.19
Recommended Approach for JavaScript ESM Stubs:Given the goal of JavaScript ESM output for @grpc/grpc-js, and the limitations of grpc-tools for direct ESM generation, using protoc-gen-ts configured to output JavaScript ESM is a strong candidate.

Install Dependencies:
Bashnpm install --save-dev @grpc/grpc-js grpc-tools protoc-gen-ts
# or if using buf
# npm install --save-dev @grpc/grpc-js @bufbuild/buf @bufbuild/protoc-gen-es @bufbuild/protoc-gen-connect-es



Scripting Code Generation:Create an npm script in package.json to orchestrate the fetching of .proto files and the generation of client stubs.


Step 1: Sync ProtobufsA script (e.g., scripts/sync_protos.sh) will be responsible for fetching the .proto files from the central protobuf repository (as per the chosen strategy in section 1.2) and placing them into the local protos/ directory.
Bash# scripts/sync_protos.sh
# Example: Clone a specific branch/tag of the proto repo and copy files
PROTO_REPO_URL="<your-central-proto-repo-url>"
PROTO_BRANCH="main" # Or a specific tag/commit
TEMP_PROTO_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
TARGET_PROTO_DIR="./protos/lab"

echo "Cloning protobufs from $PROTO_REPO_URL (branch: $PROTO_BRANCH)..."
git clone --depth 1 --branch "$PROTO_BRANCH" "$PROTO_REPO_URL" "$TEMP_PROTO_DIR"

echo "Copying.proto files to $TARGET_PROTO_DIR..."
mkdir -p "$TARGET_PROTO_DIR"
# Example: copy all.proto files, adjust path within $TEMP_PROTO_DIR as needed
cp -R "$TEMP_PROTO_DIR/path/to/your/lab/protos/"*.proto "$TARGET_PROTO_DIR/"

echo "Protobuf sync complete."
rm -rf "$TEMP_PROTO_DIR"

This script should be made executable (chmod +x scripts/sync_protos.sh).


Step 2: Generate JavaScript ESM Stubs using protoc with protoc-gen-tsThe protoc-gen-ts plugin can generate JavaScript output suitable for @grpc/grpc-js and ESM.
JSON// package.json
"scripts": {
  "sync-protos": "bash./scripts/sync_protos.sh",
  "generate-stubs": "npm run sync-protos && mkdir -p./generated/lab && protoc \\
    --plugin=protoc-gen-ts=./node_modules/.bin/protoc-gen-ts \\
    --ts_out=service=grpc-js,mode=grpc-js:./generated/lab \\
    --js_out=import_style=module,binary:./generated/lab \\
    --proto_path=./protos/lab \\
    $(find./protos/lab -name '*.proto')"
}

Explanation of protoc command options:

--plugin=protoc-gen-ts=./node_modules/.bin/protoc-gen-ts: Specifies the protoc-gen-ts plugin.
--ts_out=service=grpc-js,mode=grpc-js:./generated/lab: Instructs protoc-gen-ts to generate service definitions (service=grpc-js) compatible with @grpc/grpc-js (mode=grpc-js) into the generated/lab directory. Even though it's --ts_out, it will produce .js and .d.ts files.
--js_out=import_style=module,binary:./generated/lab: This standard protoc option generates JavaScript message classes. import_style=module is crucial for ESM import/export syntax. The output also goes to generated/lab.
--proto_path=./protos/lab: Specifies the directory where the source .proto files are located.
$(find./protos/lab -name '*.proto'): Finds all .proto files in the specified path to be processed.

This setup ensures that the generated JavaScript files use ESM import statements and include .js extensions in relative imports, which is vital for Node.js ESM resolution.16 Issues with missing .js extensions are a common pitfall in ESM environments.21



The JavaScript gRPC ecosystem's support for direct ESM generation has been evolving. While @grpc/grpc-js itself is usable within ESM projects, the tooling for generating client stubs that are natively ESM and directly compatible has historically favored CommonJS. Using protoc-gen-ts with JavaScript output provides a more direct route to generating ESM stubs for @grpc/grpc-js compared to attempting to transpile grpc-tools output or solely relying on @bufbuild/protoc-gen-es which is more aligned with the ConnectRPC ecosystem for service generation.183. Configuring Playwright and Development EnvironmentA well-configured testing environment enhances productivity and test reliability. This involves setting up Playwright, managing environment variables, and establishing code quality standards.3.1. Configuring Playwright for gRPC API Test AutomationThe playwright.config.js file is central to configuring Playwright's behavior.
Base Configuration:

testDir: Set to ./tests to point Playwright to the test files.2
timeout: Define a global timeout for tests (e.g., 30000 ms). API tests are generally faster than UI tests, so this can often be lower.
expect.timeout: Timeout for expect assertions (e.g., 5000 ms).
fullyParallel: Set to true to run test files in parallel, leveraging Playwright's execution capabilities.23
reporter: Configure reporters, such as html for local development and junit for CI integration.23
JavaScript// playwright.config.js
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

// Read from default ".env" file.
dotenv.config();

export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './tests',
  timeout: 30000, // Global timeout for each test
  expect: {
    timeout: 5000, // Timeout for expect() assertions
  },
  fullyParallel: true, // Run tests in files in parallel
  reporter: [['html', { open: 'never' }], ['list']],
  use: {
    baseURL: process.env.LAB_GATEWAY_URL |




| 'http://localhost:50051', // Example base URLtrace: 'on-first-retry',},// Example project configuration for different environments// projects:,});```
Environment Variables with dotenv:
Sensitive data or environment-specific configurations, such as the LAB gRPC gateway URL, should be managed using environment variables. The dotenv package facilitates loading these from a .env file.24

Install dotenv: npm install dotenv --save-dev
Create a .env file in the project root:
Code snippet#.env
LAB_GATEWAY_URL=your_lab_grpc_gateway_address:port


Load dotenv at the top of playwright.config.js as shown in the example above.
Playwright's request fixture, if used for any auxiliary HTTP calls (e.g., health checks), will automatically pick up settings like baseURL.26 For direct gRPC calls, the client will be instantiated using these environment variables.


Playwright serves as more than just a UI automation tool; its robust test runner, fixture system, and reporting capabilities are highly valuable for API testing, including gRPC. The configuration should aim to create a stable and predictable environment for executing these gRPC client calls.3.2. Establishing Code Quality with ESLint and Prettier for ESMMaintaining code quality is essential for a "clean" and "robust" framework. ESLint and Prettier are standard tools for this in the JavaScript ecosystem. For an ESM project, the modern flat config format (eslint.config.js) for ESLint is recommended.

Install Dependencies:
Bashnpm install --save-dev eslint prettier eslint-plugin-playwright eslint-config-prettier globals
# If using TypeScript for test framework files (optional, user asked for JS ESM):
# npm install --save-dev typescript @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin



ESLint Configuration (eslint.config.js):This configuration sets up ESLint for JavaScript ESM, integrates eslint-plugin-playwright, and ensures compatibility with Prettier.
JavaScript// eslint.config.js
import globals from "globals";
import js from "@eslint/js";
import playwright from "eslint-plugin-playwright";
import eslintConfigPrettier from "eslint-config-prettier"; // Ensures Prettier rules don't conflict

export default,
      "prefer-const": "error",
      // Add other project-specific or preferred rules
    },
  },
  { // Playwright specific configuration
    files: ["tests/**/*.js", "tests/**/*.mjs"], // Target your test files
   ...playwright.configs["flat/recommended"], // Use recommended flat config from plugin [28, 29]
    rules: {
     ...playwright.configs["flat/recommended"].rules,
      "playwright/expect-expect": "warn", // Example: relax rule to warning
      "playwright/no-focused-test": "error",
    },
  },
  eslintConfigPrettier, // Add Prettier config last to disable conflicting ESLint rules
];

This flat configuration 30 correctly sets sourceType: "module" for ESM. The eslint-plugin-playwright is applied specifically to test files using its recommended flat configuration.28


Prettier Configuration (.prettierrc.json):
JSON{
  "semi": true,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "arrowParens": "always"
}



NPM Scripts (package.json):
JSON"scripts": {
  "lint": "eslint. --ext.js,.mjs",
  "lint:fix": "eslint. --ext.js,.mjs --fix",
  "format": "prettier --write.",
  "generate-stubs": "npm run sync-protos && mkdir -p./generated/lab && protoc --plugin=protoc-gen-ts=./node_modules/.bin/protoc-gen-ts --ts_out=service=grpc-js,mode=grpc-js:./generated/lab --js_out=import_style=module,binary:./generated/lab --proto_path=./protos/lab $(find./protos/lab -name '*.proto')",
  "sync-protos": "bash./scripts/sync_protos.sh",
  "test": "npm run generate-stubs && npx playwright test",
  "test:headed": "npm run generate-stubs && npx playwright test --headed",
  "show-report": "npx playwright show-report"
}


Early adoption of these tools ensures consistency and readability, particularly important as the test suite grows and involves complex asynchronous gRPC interactions.4. Crafting gRPC Client Interactions in JavaScript (ESM)Effective interaction with gRPC services from JavaScript requires careful handling of client instantiation, asynchronous operations, and the specifics of different RPC types.4.1. Leveraging @grpc/grpc-js for gRPC Communication@grpc/grpc-js is the standard library for Node.js gRPC applications, providing the core mechanisms for client-server communication.12

Client Instantiation:Clients are instantiated using the JavaScript classes generated from the .proto files.
JavaScript// Example: lib/grpc-clients/lab_service_client.js
import * as grpc from '@grpc/grpc-js';
import { LabServiceClient as GeneratedLabServiceClient } from '../../generated/lab/your_service_grpc_pb.js'; // Adjust path
import { credentials } from '@grpc/grpc-js'; // For credentials

export function createLabServiceClient(address) {
  // Consider secure credentials for production-like environments
  return new GeneratedLabServiceClient(address, credentials.createInsecure());
}

The client should connect to the central 'LAB' gRPC gateway address, ideally configured via environment variables.


Making Unary Calls (Callback-based by default):Standard @grpc/grpc-js unary calls are callback-based.31
JavaScript// Direct callback usage (less ideal for tests)
// import { HelloRequest } from '../../generated/lab/your_service_pb.js';
// const request = new HelloRequest();
// request.setName('Test User');
// client.sayHello(request, (error, response) => {
//   if (error) {
//     console.error('gRPC Error:', error);
//     return;
//   }
//   console.log('Greeting:', response.getMessage());
// });



Handling Metadata:Metadata can be crucial for aspects like tracing or authentication.
JavaScript// const metadata = new grpc.Metadata();
// metadata.set('x-request-id', 'generated-uuid');
// client.sayHello(request, metadata, (error, response) => { /*... */ });

While @grpc/grpc-js is robust, its callback-centric nature for asynchronous operations can lead to verbose and less readable test code (often referred to as "callback hell"). Modern JavaScript development heavily favors async/await syntax for managing asynchronous operations.

4.2. Mastering Asynchronous Operations: async/await with gRPC CallsTo align with modern JavaScript practices and improve test readability, async/await should be used. This requires adapting the callback-based methods of @grpc/grpc-js.

Promisifying Unary Calls (Manual Approach):A common pattern is to wrap callback-based functions in Promises.
JavaScript// lib/utils/grpc_async_helpers.js
import * as grpc from '@grpc/grpc-js';

export function promisifyUnaryCall(client, methodName, request, metadata = new grpc.Metadata()) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    client[methodName](request, metadata, (error, response) => {
      if (error) {
        reject(error); // error object includes code and details
      } else {
        resolve(response);
      }
    });
  });
}

This utility allows calls like: const response = await promisifyUnaryCall(client, 'sayHello', request);


Using Wrapper Libraries (Recommended for Comprehensive Support):For a more robust and comprehensive solution, especially when dealing with streaming RPCs, consider using a wrapper library that provides native async/await and async iterator support for @grpc/grpc-js.

@ayonli/grpc-async: This library is designed to wrap @grpc/grpc-js with async/await functionality for both server and client, including elegant handling of all streaming types.32

Installation: npm install @ayonli/grpc-async
Client Connection:
JavaScript// lib/grpc-clients/lab_service_client.js (using @ayonli/grpc-async)
import { credentials } from '@grpc/grpc-js';
import { connect } from '@ayonli/grpc-async';
import { LabServiceService } from '../../generated/lab/your_service_grpc_pb.js'; // Generated service

export function createAsyncLabServiceClient(address) {
  // The 'connect' function from @ayonli/grpc-async wraps the generated client
  return connect(LabServiceService, address, credentials.createInsecure());
}


Unary Call with @ayonli/grpc-async:
JavaScript// const asyncClient = createAsyncLabServiceClient(LAB_GATEWAY_ADDRESS);
// const request = new HelloRequest();
// request.setName('Async User');
// const response = await asyncClient.sayHello(request); // Clean async/await
// console.log(response.getMessage());





The use of such a wrapper library significantly simplifies test code for all RPC types, making it more readable and maintainable than manual promisification, especially for complex streaming scenarios.

5. Developing Playwright Tests for Your gRPC ServicesWith the foundation in place, Playwright tests can be developed to validate the gRPC services exposed by the 'LAB' gateway.5.1. Structuring Tests with Playwright: Best Practices
Organization: Group tests logically using describe blocks, often per gRPC service or a set of related RPC methods. Individual test cases are defined using test (or it).2
Naming: Employ clear and descriptive names for test suites and individual tests to convey their purpose and the scenario being tested.2
Independence: Design tests to be independent of each other. This allows for parallel execution and prevents cascading failures, making debugging easier.23
Annotations: Utilize Playwright annotations like test.skip(), test.fixme(), and test.slow() as appropriate during development and maintenance.2
5.2. Effective Use of Playwright Test Hooks for gRPC Client LifecyclePlaywright's test hooks (beforeAll, afterAll, beforeEach, afterEach) are essential for managing the lifecycle of gRPC clients and other test resources.27JavaScript// tests/unary/lab_gateway_unary.spec.js
import { test, describe, beforeAll, afterAll, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import * as grpc from '@grpc/grpc-js'; // For grpc.status, grpc.Metadata
import { Status as GrpcStatus } from '@grpc/grpc-js'; // For status codes
// Assuming createAsyncLabServiceClient uses @ayonli/grpc-async or similar
import { createAsyncLabServiceClient } from '../../lib/grpc-clients/lab_service_client.js';
import { LabRequest, LabResponse } from '../../generated/lab/your_service_pb.js'; // Adjust paths

describe('LAB Gateway - Unary RPCs', () => {
  let client;
  const LAB_GATEWAY_ADDRESS = process.env.LAB_GATEWAY_URL |
| 'localhost:50051';

  beforeAll(async () => {
    client = createAsyncLabServiceClient(LAB_GATEWAY_ADDRESS);
    // For @grpc/grpc-js, client.waitForReady(deadline, callback) can be used
    // to ensure connection before tests. @ayonli/grpc-async handles this.
    // Example: await new Promise(resolve => client.waitForReady(Date.now() + 5000, resolve));
  });

  afterAll(async () => {
    if (client) {
      client.close(); // Ensure client connection is closed
    }
  });

  test('should successfully perform a basic unary operation', async () => {
    const request = new LabRequest();
    request.setData('test_data'); // Example: set some data on the request

    try {
      const response = await client.yourUnaryMethod(request); // Using async client
      expect(response).toBeInstanceOf(LabResponse);
      expect(response.getResult()).toBe('expected_result_for_test_data');
    } catch (error) {
      // This assertion makes the test fail if an unexpected error occurs
      console.error('Test failed due to unexpected gRPC error:', error);
      expect(error).toBeNull(); 
    }
  });
  // Further tests for other unary methods or scenarios...
});
Proper client lifecycle management within hooks ensures that connections to the LAB gateway are established before tests run and are cleanly closed afterward, preventing resource leaks.5.3. Testing Unary RPCs: Requests, Responses, and AssertionsUnary RPCs, being the simplest form, involve a single request and a single response.
Request Creation: Instantiate request messages using the classes generated from your .proto files. Populate the necessary fields.
JavaScriptconst request = new LabRequest();
request.setUserId('user-123');
request.setQuery('fetch details');


Making the Call: Use the async/await pattern with the wrapped gRPC client.
JavaScriptconst response = await client.processLabRequest(request); // Assuming 'processLabRequest' is your unary method


Asserting Responses:

Verify the response object is of the expected type.
Use Playwright's expect for assertions on the response fields.26
JavaScriptexpect(response).toBeInstanceOf(LabResponse);
expect(response.getStatusMessage()).toBe('SUCCESS');
expect(response.getDataPayload().getSomeField()).toEqual('expected value');
// For complex nested objects,.toObject() can be useful for deep equality checks
// expect(response.getComplexObject().toObject()).toEqual({ fieldA: 'valueA', fieldB: 123 });




5.4. Approaches to Testing Streaming RPCsTesting streaming RPCs (server-side, client-side, and bidirectional) introduces more complexity due to the continuous flow of messages. Using a client wrapper like @ayonli/grpc-async that provides async iterators and promise-based stream handling is highly beneficial.32

Server-Streaming RPCs: The client sends a single request, and the server responds with a stream of messages.
JavaScript// Conceptual test for server-streaming using @ayonli/grpc-async
test('should handle server-streaming responses correctly', async () => {
  const request = new StreamDataRequest();
  request.setStreamId('stream-abc');
  const receivedMessages =;
  try {
    const stream = client.getServerStream(request); // Returns an async iterable
    for await (const response of stream) {
      expect(response).toBeInstanceOf(StreamDataResponse);
      receivedMessages.push(response.toObject()); // Collect responses
    }
    expect(receivedMessages.length).toBeGreaterThan(2); // Example: expect at least 3 messages
    expect(receivedMessages.getChunkId()).toBe(0);
    // Further assertions on the content and order of receivedMessages
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Server-streaming test failed:', error);
    expect(error).toBeNull();
  }
});

The primary challenge is to collect all streamed messages for comprehensive assertion or to assert properties of messages as they arrive. Async iterators (for await...of) provided by libraries like @ayonli/grpc-async simplify consumption.32


Client-Streaming RPCs: The client sends a stream of messages, and the server responds with a single message.
JavaScript// Conceptual test for client-streaming using @ayonli/grpc-async
test('should handle client-streaming requests and get a single response', async () => {
  const requests =;
  try {
    // @ayonli/grpc-async client.clientStreamingMethod() returns a call object
    // that you can write to, and then await its.end() method for the server's response.
    const call = client.sendClientStream(); // Method name from your service
    for (const req of requests) {
      await call.write(req); // `write` might be async or sync depending on library
    }
    const summaryResponse = await call.end(); // Signals end of client stream and awaits server response

    expect(summaryResponse).toBeInstanceOf(ClientStreamSummaryResponse);
    expect(summaryResponse.getProcessedCount()).toBe(requests.length);
    // Further assertions on the summaryResponse
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Client-streaming test failed:', error);
    expect(error).toBeNull();
  }
});

The key is to correctly send all client messages, signal the end of the stream, and then await the server's single response.32


Bidirectional-Streaming RPCs: Both client and server send streams of messages independently. This is the most complex type to test.
JavaScript// Conceptual test for bidirectional-streaming using @ayonli/grpc-async
test('should handle bidirectional streaming communication', async () => {
  const call = client.bidirectionalChat(); // Method name from your service
  const serverResponses =;
  let serverStreamEnded = false;

  // Handle incoming messages from server
  const serverListenerPromise = (async () => {
    try {
      for await (const response of call) { // call itself is an async iterable for server messages
        serverResponses.push(response.toObject());
        // Optional: Send a client message in response to a server message
        // if (response.getRequiresAck()) {
        //   await call.write(new ChatMessage().setText(`ACK: ${response.getText()}`));
        // }
      }
    } catch (err) {
      // Handle server stream errors if necessary
      console.error("Error reading server stream:", err);
    } finally {
      serverStreamEnded = true;
    }
  })();

  // Send some messages from client
  await call.write(new ChatMessage().setText('Hello from client 1'));
  await call.write(new ChatMessage().setText('How are you?'));

  // Wait for a couple of server responses (example condition)
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500)); // Give server time to respond

  await call.write(new ChatMessage().setText('Client finishing up.'));
  await call.end(); // Signal client is done sending

  // Wait for server to finish sending (or timeout)
  await serverListenerPromise;

  expect(serverResponses.length).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(1); // Example assertion
  // Add more specific assertions on the sequence and content of serverResponses
  // and potentially on the interaction pattern.
  expect(serverStreamEnded).toBe(true);
});

Testing bidirectional streams often involves managing concurrent send and receive operations, asserting message sequences, and handling stream termination from either side. The @ayonli/grpc-async library simplifies this by making the call object an async iterable for server messages and providing async write and end methods for the client stream.32

5.5. Comprehensive Error Handling and Status Code ValidationgRPC employs a distinct set of status codes for errors, which are crucial for diagnosing issues.35 Tests must validate that services return appropriate status codes for various error conditions.

Importing gRPC Status Codes:The status codes are available as an enum from the @grpc/grpc-js library.
JavaScriptimport { Status as GrpcStatus } from '@grpc/grpc-js';

This is based on the export structure export enum Status { OK = 0, CANCELLED,... } found in @grpc/grpc-js/src/constants.ts.37


Asserting Expected Errors:When an RPC call is expected to fail, the test should assert the error code and, optionally, the error message.
JavaScripttest('should return NOT_FOUND for a non-existent resource', async () => {
  const request = new LabRequest();
  request.setResourceId('non-existent-id');
  try {
    await client.getLabResource(request); // Assuming this method can fail with NOT_FOUND
    // If the call succeeds, the test should fail because an error was expected.
    throw new Error('Expected gRPC call to fail with NOT_FOUND, but it succeeded.');
  } catch (error) {
    expect(error.code).toBe(GrpcStatus.NOT_FOUND);
    expect(error.details).toContain('Resource with ID non-existent-id not found.'); // Or match exact message
  }
});



Key gRPC Status Codes for Test Assertions:Understanding common gRPC status codes is vital for writing meaningful error tests.

Code (as in GrpcStatus)Numeric ValueTypical Use Case in TestsOK0Successful operation.CANCELLED1Operation cancelled by the client.UNKNOWN2Server-side error not fitting other categories.INVALID_ARGUMENT3Client provided invalid input (e.g., malformed request).DEADLINE_EXCEEDED4Operation timed out.NOT_FOUND5Requested resource not found.ALREADY_EXISTS6Attempt to create a resource that already exists.PERMISSION_DENIED7Client lacks permission for the operation.UNAUTHENTICATED16Client failed authentication.RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED8A quota or resource limit was exceeded.FAILED_PRECONDITION9System not in a state required for the operation.ABORTED10Operation aborted, often due to concurrency issues.UNAVAILABLE14Service is temporarily unavailable; retriable.INTERNAL13Unrecoverable internal server error.UNIMPLEMENTED12RPC method not implemented on the server.This table serves as a quick reference for expected status codes in various test scenarios.[35, 36] Verifying the correct error type is as critical as verifying success paths, as it confirms the API's error handling contract.
6. Elevating Your Framework: Advanced Strategies and Best PracticesBeyond basic test execution, several advanced strategies and best practices contribute to a truly robust and maintainable gRPC test automation framework.6.1. Managing Test Data for gRPC ServicesGenerating appropriate and varied request payloads for Protobuf messages is crucial for thorough testing.

Strategies for Test Data Generation:

Manual Object Creation: Suitable for simple messages but becomes cumbersome and error-prone for complex or deeply nested Protobuf messages.
Factory Functions/Builders: Develop JavaScript helper functions or classes within lib/utils/data_generators.js to construct request objects. These factories can provide default values and allow specific fields to be overridden for individual test cases, promoting reusability.
Data Generation Libraries:

@faker-js/faker: Useful for populating message fields with realistic-looking primitive data types (names, addresses, numbers, etc.).38 This library can be integrated into factory functions to enhance the realism of test data. It does not, however, inherently understand Protobuf schemas.
JavaScript// lib/utils/data_generators.js
import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker';
import { UserProfileRequest } from '../../generated/lab/user_service_pb.js';

export function createRandomUserProfileRequest() {
  const request = new UserProfileRequest();
  request.setFirstName(faker.person.firstName());
  request.setLastName(faker.person.lastName());
  request.setEmail(faker.internet.email());
  request.setAge(faker.number.int({ min: 18, max: 99 }));
  return request;
}




Schema-Aware Data Generation (Advanced): While direct .proto to JavaScript mock object generation tools are less common, an alternative is to generate TypeScript definitions from .proto files (e.g., using ts-proto 20 or @bufbuild/protoc-gen-es with target=ts 16) and then use TypeScript-aware mock generation libraries like intermock 42 against these TypeScript definitions. For a pure JavaScript approach, one might leverage reflection capabilities if provided by the Protobuf message classes (e.g., protobuf.js has reflection features 43) to build custom, generic data generators.



Organizing Test Data:

For common or complex request payloads, consider storing templates as JSON or JS objects in a dedicated test data directory, loaded dynamically by tests.
Utilize Playwright's parameterization features or loop constructs to run the same test logic with different data inputs.


Effective test data management is critical. While Protobuf's strong typing catches malformed data early, testing with diverse valid inputs and boundary conditions is key to uncovering logic errors in services.6.2. Ensuring Framework Cleanliness, Robustness, and MaintainabilityA clean, robust, and maintainable framework relies on consistent practices:
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Abstract common operations such as gRPC client setup, request message construction, and frequently used assertion patterns into helper functions. These should reside in lib/utils/ or more specific client wrappers in lib/grpc-clients/.
Configuration Management: Centralize configurations like service endpoints, default timeouts, and other parameters. Use .env files for environment-specific settings (e.g., gateway URLs for dev, staging, prod) and access them via process.env in playwright.config.js and test files.24
Clear Test Naming and Structure: Adhere to Playwright's best practices for test organization, using describe and test blocks effectively with descriptive names.2
Version Control for Generated Code: Generated client stubs and message classes (typically in the generated/ directory) should NOT be committed to Git. They should be generated dynamically as part of the build or test setup process (e.g., via an npm run generate-stubs script). Add generated/ to your .gitignore file. This practice keeps the repository clean, avoids merge conflicts in auto-generated files, and ensures that tests always use stubs generated from the most recently synced .proto files.44
Dependency Management: Regularly update core dependencies like Playwright, @grpc/grpc-js, code generation tools (protoc-gen-ts), and any wrapper libraries. Use npm audit to check for vulnerabilities.
Documentation: Maintain a README.md file for the test framework. This should document the project structure, setup instructions (including proto syncing and stub generation), how to write new tests, and any framework-specific conventions.
6.3. Addressing Common Pitfalls in gRPC Test AutomationAnticipating and mitigating common issues is key to reliable gRPC testing:
Flaky Tests due to Asynchronicity: Ensure rigorous use of async/await for all asynchronous operations. All Promises returned by gRPC calls or helper utilities must be properly awaited or handled. Unhandled promises are a primary source of flakiness.
Complex Stream Assertions: For streaming RPCs, especially bidirectional ones, assertions can be challenging.

Collect all messages from server streams into an array before asserting, if the stream is finite and small.
For long or infinite streams, assert on messages incrementally or test specific interaction patterns.
For bidirectional streams, consider testing client-to-server and server-to-client flows with some degree of isolation if full concurrent interaction is too complex to reliably assert. Ensure proper handling of stream termination signals from both client and server.


Managing Protobuf Versions and Breaking Changes: The chosen protobuf management strategy (Section 1.2) must be strictly followed. Ideally, breaking changes in .proto definitions should cause the npm run generate-stubs command to fail or produce incompatible code, thus breaking tests at the build/generation phase rather than leading to obscure runtime failures.8 This provides early feedback.
Network Instability and Gateway Issues: Tests should clearly differentiate between actual service logic failures and environmental problems (network glitches, gateway unavailability). While Playwright offers test retries, these should be used judiciously for API tests. Connection errors to the gateway might warrant a retry, but persistent failures should fail the test run.
Over-Mocking vs. True Integration Testing: Since the goal is to test the Elixir services through the 'LAB' gRPC gateway, mocking should be minimized or avoided entirely at this level of testing. These are integration/end-to-end tests for the gRPC services.
Error Handling Granularity: Ensure tests not only check if an error occurred but also validate the specific gRPC status code (e.g., INVALID_ARGUMENT, NOT_FOUND) and, where appropriate, parts of the error message. This verifies the error handling contract of the service.
A well-designed framework anticipates these challenges and provides patterns or utilities to address them, leading to more stable and trustworthy test results.7. Execution, Analysis, and Continuous ImprovementThe final stages involve running the tests, analyzing results, and integrating the framework into a CI/CD pipeline for continuous feedback.7.1. Running Your gRPC Test Suite with PlaywrightPlaywright's CLI provides flexible options for test execution:
Run all tests: npx playwright test
Run tests in a specific file: npx playwright test tests/unary/lab_gateway_unary.spec.js
Run a specific test by title: npx playwright test -g "should return NOT_FOUND"
Headed mode (for debugging, though less common for API tests): npx playwright test --headed
Playwright automatically runs test files in parallel, which can significantly speed up execution of a large test suite.23
7.2. Leveraging Playwright Reports for Insightful AnalysisPlaywright offers built-in reporters that are invaluable for understanding test outcomes:
HTML Reporter: Generates an interactive HTML report. View it using npx playwright show-report. This report details each test, steps, assertions, errors, and console logs.23
List Reporter: Provides concise console output during test execution.
JUnit Reporter: Useful for CI systems, generates XML reports (reporter: [['junit', { outputFile: 'results.xml' }]]).
Trace Viewer: While primarily for UI tests, the trace viewer can still provide some insights into network calls if Playwright's APIRequestContext is used for any HTTP interactions. For direct gRPC calls, console logs and detailed error messages within the report will be the primary debugging aids.
7.3. CI/CD IntegrationIntegrating the gRPC test suite into a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is essential for automated validation.

Pipeline Steps: A typical CI pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions 23) would include:

Checkout the test framework repository.
Set up the Node.js environment.
Install project dependencies (npm ci).
Execute the protobuf synchronization script (npm run sync-protos).
Generate the gRPC client stubs (npm run generate-stubs which implicitly runs sync first).
Run the Playwright tests (npx playwright test).
Publish test reports as artifacts (e.g., HTML report, JUnit XML).

This CI setup ensures that every code change is automatically validated against the gRPC services, providing rapid feedback on the health of the system. The pipeline must accurately replicate the local development environment's steps for protobuf synchronization and code generation to ensure consistency.8. Conclusion: Building a Future-Proof gRPC Test Automation FrameworkThe approach detailed in this report provides a robust foundation for creating a well-organized, clean, and maintainable Playwright test automation framework for your Elixir-based gRPC services. By adopting JavaScript ESM, structuring the project logically, implementing a sound strategy for managing .proto files from a separate repository, and correctly generating ESM-compatible @grpc/grpc-js client stubs, the framework is positioned for long-term success.Key elements contributing to its robustness include:
Clear Separation of Concerns: A dedicated test repository with a well-defined structure.
Modern JavaScript Practices: Utilization of ESM and async/await, facilitated by wrapper libraries for gRPC calls.
Automated Code Generation: Ensuring client stubs are consistently generated from the latest proto definitions.
Comprehensive Test Coverage: Strategies for testing unary, server-streaming, client-streaming, and bidirectional-streaming RPCs, including thorough error and status code validation.
Maintainability: Emphasis on DRY principles, centralized configuration, and robust CI/CD integration.
The gRPC landscape and associated tooling are continually evolving. Therefore, the framework should be viewed as a living system. Regular updates to dependencies, refinement of test strategies (especially for complex streaming scenarios), and adaptation to changes in the Elixir services and their gRPC contracts will be crucial. By adhering to the principles and practices outlined, your company can build a high-quality, reliable gRPC testing solution that effectively supports the development and maintenance of its 'LAB' gateway and associated Elixir services.
